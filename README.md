# Minesweaper

A Minesweaper application made using Java and JFX. 
All resources were created by me however anyone can use them if needed for their own projects.

### TODO:
* Proper scaling of the board so it doesn't have to be NxN
* Custom field option
* Clock can go past 999 (without adding four digits to HUD?)
* Keep track of high scores
* High scores are stored on a global leaderboard
* Add comments

### Bugs:
* 10x10 sometimes only generates 9 mines instead of 10.
* Clock will count for one more tick after winning
