# Minesweeper

A Minesweaper application made using Java and JFX. 
All resources except the icon were created by me however anyone can use them if needed for their own projects.

### TODO:
* Proper scaling of the board so it doesn't have to be NxN
* ~~Custom field option~~
* ~~Clock can go past 999~~
* ~~Keep track of high scores~~
* High scores are stored on a global leaderboard
* ~~Detect out of date version~~
* ~~Add comments~~
* ~~Add a debugger that logs information to a file~~
* Compatible with both Windows and macOS

### Bugs:
* ~~x10 sometimes only generates 9 mines instead of 10~~
* Clock will count for one more tick after winning
* ~~Certain dimensions for a custom game can cause a thin white streak to appear across the board~~
